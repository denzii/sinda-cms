# sinda-cms

To run the app locally:

1. cd into SindaCMS/client 
2. run npm start (will watch your files and update the bundle in wwwroot folder)
3. double click on SindaCMS.sln in the root folder
4. run the application through visual studio

#TODOs
1. configure webpack to output css images with the same name or remove the bundle each time before creating new one with webpack --watch
2. configure webpack to detect entry points dynamically without specifying each file
